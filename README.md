**S**ingle **C**ell **A**ncestral **N**ode **T**axonomy **I**nference by **P**arcellation **O**f **D**ifferential **E**xpression. The model is an extension of the SCVI paradigm--a structured generative, variational inference model developed for the simultaneous analysis (DE) and categorization (taxonomy generation) of cell types across evolution (or now any covariate) using single-cell RNA-seq data. It was originally developed from a simplified model of scANVI and is built on the pytorch-based PPL pyro.

You can read about the generative model [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nmcmcjtvmfcb#acf7a4). You can look at example runs [here](examples/outputs/).

Please reach out to let me know if you try ANTIPODE on a dataset and it works (or doesn't work)... The model is (forever) a work in procress!
