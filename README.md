Single Cell Ancestral Node Taxonomy Inference by Parcellation of Differential Expression. The model is a variational inference model developed for the simultaneous analysis (DE) and categorization (taxonomy generation) of cell types across evolution (or now any covariate) using single-cell RNA-seq data. It was originally developed from a simplified model of scANVI and is built on the pytorch-based PPL pyro.
